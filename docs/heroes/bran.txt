# Playstyle Summary

Bran is the master of the long game. While other heroes fear longer fights, Bran uses them to stack his Fortify passive and outlast the opposition.

**Combat Flow:** Use Shield Slam to interrupt heavy enemy attacks. Maintain Fortify as often as possible; even if the fight is safe, using it contributes to his permanent 6-use stat unlock.

**Scaling Strategy:** He heals based on Missing HP, meaning he is most dangerous when he's taken a few hits. Crushing Blow ensures that once an enemy is weakened, they cannot escape.

**Shop Priority**:

* **DEF**: This is Bran's best stat, as Shield Slam scales its damage directly from his DEF.

* **Max HP**: Increases the buffer for his Iron Will passive to heal him back from the brink.
