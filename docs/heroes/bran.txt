BRAN
The Village Defender

Unlock: Starter (Free)

LORE

Born in the farming village of Oakenshield, Bran picked up a sword not for glory, but to protect his home. With no noble training or legendary power, he fights through sheer strength and stubborn resolve.

"You want to hurt them? You'll have to go through me first."

PLAYSTYLE SUMMARY

Bran is the master of the long game. While other heroes fear longer fights, Bran uses them to stack his Fortify passive and outlast the opposition.

- Combat Flow: Use Shield Slam to interrupt heavy enemy attacks. Maintain Fortify as often as possible; even if the fight is safe, using it contributes to his permanent stat unlock.
- Scaling Strategy: He heals based on Missing HP, meaning he is most dangerous when he's taken a few hits. Crushing Blow ensures that once an enemy is weakened, they cannot escape.
- Shop Priority: DEF is his best stat (Shield Slam scaling). Max HP increases the buffer for Iron Will.
