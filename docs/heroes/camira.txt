PLAYSTYLE SUMMARY

Camira plays the "Economy Game," generating massive amounts of Crystals for the shop.

- Tactical Loop: Rapid Fire and Jackpot Arrow do not trigger the passive. Use them when the passive is on cooldown or for their utility.
- Economy: Prioritize landing the killing blow with Jackpot Arrow for the crystal bonus.
- Defense: Time Forest Agility to evade heavy hits and use Rapid Fire to heal back health.
- Shop Priority: ATK (synergizes with crits and lifesteal) and DEF (for stability).
