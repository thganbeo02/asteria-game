# Playstyle Summary

Camira plays the "Economy Game." She is relatively fragile early on, but her ability to generate massive amounts of Crystals makes her the most consistent shopper.

**Tactical Loop:** Since Rapid Fire and Jackpot Arrow do not trigger the passive, they should be used when the passive is not ready or when you need their specific utility (healing or gold stealing).

**Economy:** Her primary goal is to reach the killing blow with Jackpot Arrow, which can drop up to 600 bonus Crystals at level 7.

**Defense:** Survival depends on timing Forest Agility to evade heavy hits and using Rapid Fire to heal back health after taking damage.

**Shop Priority:**

* **ATK:** Synergizes with her high crit chance and Rapid Fire's healing-on-damage.

* **DEF:** Since she can steal Max HP via crits (Wait, passive says Mana not Max HP, code check: Passive restores Mana. Forest Agility grants Max HP from lvl 5. Code says "From Level 5: Also gain 12-15 random max HP"). Corrected based on code.
