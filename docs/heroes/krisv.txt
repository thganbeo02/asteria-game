## Lore

KrisV hails from the distant Iron Isles, a land of black powder, clockwork engineering, and mechanical innovation where firearms long ago replaced bows. Once renowned as the greatest marksman the Isles had ever produced, he was capable of threading a bullet through a keyhole from a thousand yards away.

But fame brought tragedy. Hired by a corrupt noble to eliminate a supposed traitor, KrisV carried out the contract with absolute precision—only to discover that the target was an innocent reformer fighting for justice. The realization shattered him.

Consumed by guilt, he destroyed his old rifle and fled across the sea to Asteria. There, far from the Iron Isles, he rebuilt his weapon in secret. Now, he vows to use his skill only on true monsters—and to ensure he never makes the same mistake again.
