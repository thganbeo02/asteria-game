LORE

Lyra was a librarian's apprentice at the Ashen Academy until she accidentally burned it down discovering her gift. Now she wanders, turning her volatile magic into a force for good—one carefully controlled explosion at a time.

"Knowledge is power. Fire is just... faster."

- 3 Stacks: +30% ability damage and spells ignore 15% DEF.
- Reset: Using a basic attack resets Momentum to 0. If resetting from max stacks, Lyra restores 3-21 Mana.

PLAYSTYLE SUMMARY

Lyra is a technical caster who rewards turn planning to maintain Arcane Momentum.

- Combat Flow: Avoid basic attacks unless mana is critical, as resetting Momentum loses significant damage. Aim for 3 stacks for the DEF penetration.
- Scaling Strategy: Lyra is a Battle-Mage. Pyroclasm grants permanent stats with every cast, rewarding players who manage her mana well.
- Shop Priority: Max HP is critical (Frost Barrier scales with Max HP). ATK is necessary to end fights before her mana regen is overwhelmed.
