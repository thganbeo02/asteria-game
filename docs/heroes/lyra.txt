## Lore

Lyra was a librarian's apprentice at the Ashen Academy until she accidentally burned it down discovering her gift. Now she wanders, turning her volatile magic into a force for good—one carefully controlled explosion at a time.

# Passive - **Arcane Momentum**

### **Hover Tooltip**

```
Arcane Momentum
Consecutive spells grow stronger. Basic attacks reset the chain but restore mana.
```

### **Expanded Tooltip Panel**

```
Arcane Momentum
Lyra's magic builds upon itself, rewarding commitment to spellcasting. Each consecutive ability used grants 1 Momentum stack, up to 3.

Momentum Bonuses:
- 1 Stack: +10% ability damage
- 2 Stacks: +20% ability damage
- 3 Stacks: +30% ability damage, and spells ignore 15% DEF

Using a basic attack resets Momentum to 0. When max Momentum is reset, she gains 3 / 6 / 9 / 12 / 15 / 18 / 21 Mana.

# Playstyle Summary

Lyra is a technical caster who rewards players for planning their turn order to maintain Arcane Momentum.

**Combat Flow:** Never use a basic attack unless you are out of mana, as it resets your Momentum stacks. The goal is to reach 3 stacks to ignore enemy DEF.

**Scaling Strategy:** She is a "Battle-Mage" who grows sturdier over time. Pyroclasm grants permanent ATK and Max HP with every cast, rewarding players who can sustain her high mana costs.

**Shop Priority**:

* **Max HP:** This is critical for Lyra because her Frost Barrier absorbs 50% of her Max HP. A larger health pool directly creates a larger shield.

* **ATK:** Necessary to boost the scaling on Firebolt and Pyroclasm to end fights before her mana regen (5/turn) is overwhelmed.
