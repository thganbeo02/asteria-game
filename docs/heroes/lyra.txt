LORE

Lyra was a librarian's apprentice at the Ashen Academy until she accidentally burned it down discovering her gift. Now she wanders, turning her volatile magic into a force for good—one carefully controlled explosion at a time.

"Knowledge is power. Fire is just... faster."

PLAYSTYLE SUMMARY

Lyra is a technical caster who rewards turn planning to maintain Arcane Momentum.

- Combat Flow: Avoid basic attacks unless mana is critical, as resetting Momentum loses significant damage. Aim for 3 stacks for the DEF penetration.
- Scaling Strategy: Lyra is a Battle-Mage. Pyroclasm grants permanent stats with every cast, rewarding players who manage her mana well.
- Shop Priority: Max HP is critical (Frost Barrier scales with Max HP). ATK is necessary to end fights before her mana regen is overwhelmed.

CHANGELOG

Unreleased:
- Buff: Base HP 85 -> 93.
- Buff: Base ATK 12 -> 15.
- Buff: Firebolt damage scaling 100-220% -> 120-240%.
- Buff: Frost Barrier shatter damage scaling 60-120% -> 70-130%.
- Buff: Pyroclasm mana cost 24-48 -> 18-42.
- Buff: Arcane Momentum reset mana 3-21 -> 4-28.
- Fix: Implement Arcane Momentum (ability stacking 0 -> 3, +10/20/30% ability damage; at 3 stacks, +15% Penetration).
- Fix: Arcane Momentum now resets on basic attack; resetting from 3 stacks restores 4-28 Mana.
- Fix: Firebolt now restores 4-16 Mana on Kill.
- Fix: Pyroclasm now consumes Burn for bonus damage equal to remaining Burn and grants 2-14 permanent ATK and Max HP per cast.
