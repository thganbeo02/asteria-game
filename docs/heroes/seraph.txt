## Lore

Seraph is the last of the Astral Hunters—warriors chosen by the Moonbound Constellations themselves. When the Starfall War shattered the celestial gates, most of her order perished defending the boundaries between realms. She alone survived, bonded to Lunaris, an astral wolf woven from pure moonlight and starfire.

Her bow doesn't fire ordinary arrows—it channels fragments of collapsing stars, each shot a piece of cosmic devastation. Lunaris fights beside her, a manifestation of her will and the heavens' fury. Together, they hunt the creatures that slip through the cracks in reality, ensuring the mortal realm stays safe from what lurks beyond the stars.

* **+2-8 Max HP** every time **Astral Howl** is cast (scales with level)
* **+50% of all stat gains** for **Lunaris** from any source:
  * Shop purchases (HP, ATK, DEF upgrades)
  * Item bonuses

  * Stacks infinitely throughout the run
  
**Example 1:** Seraph purchases +10 Max HP from shop → Lunaris gains +5 Max HP automatically

**Example 2:** Seraph casts Astral Howl at 3 charges → Serapha gains +2-8 Max HP (ability) → Lunaris gains +1-4 Max HP (50% share) AND +2-8 ATK (3-charge consumption) → Heals both

These bonuses persist across waves in endless mode.

# Strengths & Weaknesses

## Strengths
* **High total damage output** - Serapha + Lunaris combined (arrows + assists + forced attacks)
* **Built-in sustain** - Lifesteal when below 70% HP, healing from Astral Howl and Starfall Requiem crits
* **Infinite scaling** - Multiple sources of permanent growth (Celestial Arrow kills, Astral Howl casts, Lunaris empowerment)
* **Adaptive playstyle** - Can play aggressive (spam charges) or patient (build to 3 for empowerment)
* **Strong buff/debuff synergy** - Moonmark + Starlit Vigor create massive damage windows
* **Pet provides bonus actions** - Lunaris assists don't consume turns (75-100% uptime)
* **Rewards mastery** - Optimal charge management and HP management maximize output
* **Visually spectacular** - Cosmic theme with stars, wolves, and celestial effects

## Weaknesses
* **Fragile** - 72 HP and 7 DEF make her vulnerable to burst damage
* **Loses significant damage if Lunaris dies** - Pet provides majority of damage
* **Requires setup time** - 3 turns minimum to reach 3 Starlight Charges for empowerment
* **Mana-intensive rotation** - Full combo costs 90 mana (18 + 22 + 50)
* **Complex resource juggling** - Managing Starlight Charges + Lunaris HP + Serapha HP thresholds + Mana
* **Pet revival downtime** - 2-3 turns without Lunaris is brutal
* **RNG dependency** - 75% assist chance can feel inconsistent at high HP
* **High skill floor** - Difficult for new players to pilot effectively

# Implementation Notes

## Starlight Charge Mechanics
* Charges generated BEFORE ability resolves
* Consumption checks happen AFTER generation
* Example: Astral Howl at 2 charges → generates 1 → now at 3 → triggers consumption → heals → Lunaris empowered → ends at 0

## Lunaris Assist Mechanic
* Triggers after Serapha's damage is applied to enemy
* Rolls 75% chance per damage instance (or 100% if Serapha below 70% HP)
* Each Celestial Arrow = 1 roll (75% chance)
* Each Starfall Requiem arrow = 4 rolls (4 separate 75% chances, or 100% if below 70% HP)
* Assist attack is separate damage instance (can crit independently)
* Does NOT count as Serapha's turn
* Visual: Wolf lunges from beside Serapha, bites enemy, returns

## Lifesteal Calculation (Below 70% HP)
* Only triggers when Serapha is below 70% HP
* Calculation: Lunaris damage × (15-45% based on level) = heal amount
* Healing applies immediately after Lunaris's damage
* Visual: Blue/white particles flow from enemy to Serapha
* Stacks with other healing sources

## Lunaris Stat Scaling
* Tracks Serapha's total permanent stat gains
* Applies 50% modifier automatically in real-time
* Shop purchases affect both immediately
* Ability growth (Celestial Arrow kills, Astral Howl casts) shares to Lunaris
* Visual: When Serapha gains stats, small sparkle appears on Lunaris

## Constellation Bond Empowerment
* Triggers whenever 3 Starlight Charges are consumed
* Currently triggers on: Astral Howl (at 3 charges), Starfall Requiem (if cast at 3 charges)
* Lunaris gains +2-8 ATK permanently (scales with player level)
* Visual: Starlight energy flows into Lunaris, he glows brightly for 1 second
* Stacks infinitely throughout run

## Lunaris Attack Timing
* **Assist attacks:** Triggered by Serapha damaging enemy (75-100% chance rolls)
* **Forced attacks:** Guaranteed attacks from Starfall Requiem (1-3 based on charges consumed)
* **Both types appear in combat log separately**
* Animation: Lunaris lunges from beside Serapha, bites enemy, returns

## Pet Death & Revival
* Lunaris death animation: Fades into starlight particles
* Revival countdown displays: "Lunaris revives in X turns"
* Revival trigger: At start of Serapha's turn (before she acts)
* Revived Lunaris returns at full HP
* Revival time: 3 turns baseline, 2 turns if Serapha has 3 Starlight Charges when revival triggers

## Moonmark Debuff
* Only affects damage FROM Lunaris, not Serapha
* Stacks multiplicatively with Lunaris's base ATK increases
* Visual: Moon symbol floats above enemy's head
* Duration: 3 turns, starts counting at end of turn applied

## Stellar Wound DoT
* Deals 4% enemy max HP per turn for 2 turns (8% total)
* Damage applies at end of enemy's turn
* Visual: Cosmic energy particles burning on enemy
* Only applied by Starfall Requiem's final attack when cast at 3 charges

## Starfall Requiem Sequence
* Phase 1: 4 arrows fire in rapid succession (0.3s between each)
  * Each arrow triggers Lunaris Assist roll (75-100% chance)
* Phase 2: Lunaris makes 1-3 forced attacks (based on charges consumed)
  * Guaranteed attacks, separate from Assist triggers
* Healing triggers after all arrow crits calculated
* Lunaris Empowerment (+2-8 ATK) triggers if 3 charges consumed
* Total animation: ~4-5 seconds

---

# Balance Considerations

## Design Intent
* High risk/high reward beastmaster archetype
* Intentionally fragile to justify massive damage output
* Punishes poor pet and HP management, rewards mastery
* Premium complexity justifies premium price
* Infinite scaling through multiple systems (kills, casts, charge consumption)

## Tuning Knobs (Post-Launch)

**If too strong:**
- Reduce Lunaris assist chance (75% → 65%)
- Reduce lifesteal percentage (15-45% → 10-35%)
- Increase Lunaris revival time (3 → 4 turns baseline)
- Reduce Moonmark bonus (+30% → +25%)
- Increase mana costs
- Reduce permanent growth scaling (lower level-based bonuses)

**If too weak:**
- Increase Serapha's base HP (72 → 80)
- Increase Lunaris base HP (40 → 50)
- Increase assist chance (75% → 85%)
- Reduce Lunaris revival time (3 → 2 turns baseline)
- Reduce mana costs
- Increase Lunaris's share of stat gains (50% → 60%)

## Damage Distribution
* **Serapha:** ~35% of total damage (arrows + abilities)
* **Lunaris Assists:** ~40% of total damage (75-100% trigger rate)
* **Lunaris Forced Attacks:** ~25% of total damage (Starfall Requiem)
* **Total ceiling:** Variable based on assists, but ~8-10× ATK in optimal 4-turn combo with assists

## Scaling Throughout Run
**Early Game (Encounters 1-10):**
- Serapha: 72 HP, 18 ATK
- Lunaris: 40 HP, 9 ATK (50% of Serapha's)
- Fragile but manageable

**Mid Game (Encounters 11-20):**
- Serapha: ~120 HP (+48 from Astral Howl casts), ~30 ATK (+12 from kills)
- Lunaris: ~64 HP (+24 from shares), ~21 ATK (+6 from shares, +6 from empowerments)
- Both scale proportionally

**Late Game (Encounters 21+):**
- Serapha: ~180+ HP, ~50+ ATK
- Lunaris: ~110+ HP, ~40+ ATK
- Lunaris becomes primary damage dealer

## Lunaris Scaling Solution
**Problem:** Base 40 HP makes Lunaris too squishy in late game

**Solution 1 - 50% Shared Scaling:**
- Shop HP upgrades (+15 HP) → Lunaris +7.5 HP
- Items with +HP → Lunaris benefits
- Ability growth (Astral Howl +2-8 HP) → Lunaris gets +1-4 HP
- By encounter 20: Serapha might have +100 HP → Lunaris has +50 HP (90 total)

**Solution 2 - Constellation Bond Empowerment:**
- Every 3-charge consumption = +2-8 ATK for Lunaris
- Incentivizes building to 3 charges frequently
- Makes Lunaris's damage scale faster than his tankiness (glass cannon pet)

**Why 50% Share?**
- Keeps Lunaris relevant without making him tankier than Serapha
- Encourages HP investment in shops (benefits both)
- Scales proportionally throughout entire run
- Prevents Lunaris from becoming unkillable

## Economy Balance
* Premium price ($6.99 / 3500 Essence) justified by:
  * Unique pet system (first and only in game)
  * High visual quality requirements (dual characters, cosmic VFX)
  * Multiple resource systems (Charges + Lunaris HP + Serapha HP thresholds)
  * High skill ceiling with infinite scaling potential
  * Development complexity (pet AI, assist rolls, coordinated animations)
  * Not pay-to-win: Similar damage ceiling to other rangers, higher complexity
