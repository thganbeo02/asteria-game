SHADE
The Hollow Blade

Unlock: Starter (Free)

LORE

Shade has no memory of who she was before the ritual. The cult that created her intended a perfect killer — obedient, emotionless, disposable. She proved them wrong on all counts. Now she takes contracts on those who would create more like her, striking fast and collecting her due.

"Time is money. Yours is running out."

CORE MECHANIC - CONTRACT

At the start of each encounter, Shade receives a Contract — a turn limit to kill the enemy for bonus rewards.

[ CONTRACT: Kill in 5 turns ]
[ Reward: +50% Crystals, +30% EXP ]
[ Turn: 2 / 5  ██████░░░░ ]

- Casual: 5-6 turns | +10% Crystals | +10% EXP | 45% Roll Chance
- Standard: 4-5 turns | +15% Crystals | +20% EXP | 35% Roll Chance
- Rush: 3-4 turns | +25% Crystals | +30% EXP | 15% Roll Chance
- Impossible: 2 turns | +50% Crystals | +50% EXP | +5 Gold | 5% Roll Chance

Rules:
- Contract assigned randomly at encounter start.
- Kill within turn limit = bonus Crystals and EXP.
- Miss the timer = normal rewards (no penalty).
- Contract bonuses stack with difficulty multipliers.
