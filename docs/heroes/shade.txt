# Shade — *The Hollow Blade*

**Unlock:** Starter (Free) | **Difficulty:** ⭐⭐ Beginner | **Class:** Assassin (Bounty Hunter)

---

## Lore

Shade has no memory of who she was before the ritual. The cult that created her intended a perfect killer — obedient, emotionless, disposable. She proved them wrong on all counts. Now she takes contracts on those who would create more like her, striking fast and collecting her due.

> **"Time is money. Yours is running out."**

## Core Mechanic — Contract

At the start of each encounter, Shade receives a **Contract** — a turn limit to kill the enemy for bonus rewards.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  CONTRACT: Kill in 5 turns          │
│  Reward: +50% Crystals, +30% EXP    │
│  Turn: 2 / 5  ██████░░░░            │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

| Contract | Turn Limit | Crystal Bonus | EXP Bonus | Roll Chance |
|----------|------------|---------------|-----------|-------------|
| Casual | 5-6 turns | +20% | +10% | 45% |
| Standard | 4-5 turns | +30% | +20% | 35% |
| Rush | 3-4 turns | +50% | +30% | 15% |
| Impossible | 2 turns | +100% | +50%, +5 Gold | 5% |

**Rules:**
- Contract assigned randomly at encounter start
- Kill within turn limit = bonus Crystals and EXP
- Miss the timer = normal rewards (no penalty)
- Contract bonuses stack with difficulty multipliers

# Playstyle Summary

Shade is a high-tempo hero whose power is directly tied to her speed and efficiency. She is the only character who actively benefits from ending fights quickly via her Contract system.

**Combat Flow:** You must balance using **Quickblade** for mana-efficient damage and **Phantom Step** to stay alive when a contract is about to expire.

**Scaling Strategy:** Her **Professional Killer** passive rewards win streaks with permanent stat boosts, making her the "snowball" character. Use Collect as a finisher to maximize Crystal gains for the shop.

**Shop Priority**:

* **ATK:** Essential to ensure enemies die within the Contract turn limit.

* **Max HP:** Secondary, primarily to increase the effectiveness of her % Max HP heal on successful contracts.
