# Patch 0.1.1 Notes

**Date:** 2026-01-31

## Highlights

*   **Bran Rework:** Bran receives a significant update to his kit to better fulfill his "Village Defender" fantasy. Shield Slam now scales with Defense, and Fortify grants permanent Max HP.
*   **Shop Visuals:** The Shop screen has been redesigned to match the Combat interface, featuring a unified 3-column layout and cleaner visuals.
*   **Combat UI:** New "effective stats" display in the Hero Panel shows exactly how much Defense you're gaining from buffs like Fortify.

## Heroes

### Bran
Bran's identity as a scaling tank is solidified. We've removed crit interactions from his abilities to focus power into his Defense and Max HP scaling.

*   **Abilities no longer crit.** (Basic attacks still can).
*   **Shield Slam:**
    *   **New Scaling:** Now deals **110-170% ATK + 25% DEF**. (Previously just ATK).
    *   *Dev Note: This rewards Bran heavily for stacking Defense items.*
*   **Fortify:**
    *   **Buff:** Defense bonus is now clearly visible in the UI as `(+X)` green text.
    *   **New Mechanic:** When the buff expires, Bran gains **5-15 Permanent Max HP** (based on level).
    *   *Dev Note: This allows Bran to "farm" stats during safe moments in a fight.*
*   **Crushing Blow:**
    *   **Optimization:** Damage is now calculated properly against the enemy's *effective* Defense (after debuffs).

### Camira
*   **Text Fix:** Jackpot Arrow tooltip now correctly displays the crystal reward range (20-600).
*   **Text Fix:** Passive description clarified to "Every 3rd basic attack".

## Systems

### Shop
*   **Layout:** Reworked to use the standard Combat layout (Hero Panel on left, Actions on right).
*   **Visuals:** Added a purchase animation ("bounce") when buying items.
*   **Clarity:** Hero Panel in Shop mode is now compact (hides status effects) to reduce clutter.
*   **Navigation:** Added a "Ready" section to clearly signal when to return to combat.

### User Interface
*   **Hero Panel:**
    *   Added detailed stats grid: **CRIT CH**, **CRIT MULT**, **DODGE**, **PEN**.
    *   Defense now shows effective value with modifiers (e.g., `24 (+12)`).
    *   Crystals are now displayed prominently under the Hero's name.
*   **Hero Medallion:**
    *   New circular portrait with an integrated EXP progress ring and level badge.
*   **Stat Animations:**
    *   Stats now "bump" (green/up) or "drop" (red/down) when they change value.

## Bugfixes
*   Fixed an issue where hero level scaling was off-by-one (Level 2 was using Level 1 scaling values).
*   Fixed an issue where "Skip Turn" could sometimes fail to trigger the monster's turn properly.
*   Fixed tooltip display for status effects not calculating effective Defense correctly.
