# Patch 0.1.2 Notes

**Date:** 2026-02-01

## Highlights

*   **Bran (Adjust):** Smoother early game and a less abrupt power spike.

## Heroes

### Bran
Bran's early fights were too punishing until his first milestone, and his post-mastery spike was snowballing too hard. We are smoothing his curve by lowering early ratios, making Fortify's payoff repeatable, and increasing the reward for securing executes.

*   **Shield Slam (Nerf):** ATK Ratio 110 / 120 / 130 / 140 / 150 / 160 / 170% -> 90 / 100 / 110 / 120 / 130 / 140 / 150%
*   **Fortify (Adjust):**
    *   DEF Bonus 30 / 37.5 / 45 / 52.5 / 60 / 67.5 / 75% -> 40 / 45 / 50 / 55 / 60 / 65 / 70%
    *   Mastery: After 6 uses (+20 ATK, +15% Pen) -> Every 5 uses (+10 ATK, +5% Pen, stacks)
*   **Crushing Blow (Adjust):**
    *   ATK Ratio 160 / 175 / 190 / 205 / 220 / 235 / 250% -> 140 / 155 / 170 / 185 / 200 / 215 / 230%
    *   Missing HP Damage 25% -> 20%
    *   On Kill Stats +2 / 3 / 4 / 5 / 6 / 7 / 8 ATK and DEF -> +3 / 5 / 7 / 9 / 11 / 13 / 15 ATK and DEF

## Bugfixes

*   **Bran (Fix):** Fortify tooltip now describes the mastery bonus as "Every 5 uses" and shows progress as (X/5).
